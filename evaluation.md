## **Issues and Suggestions**

### **1. Accuracy Enhancement**
- **Issue**: An accuracy of 76.92% indicates ~23% incorrect predictions, which may not be sufficient for critical applications.

- **Suggestions**:
  - **Feature Engineering**:
    - Explore new features or transformations to better capture patterns in the data.
  - **Model Tuning**:
    - Experiment with alternative algorithms and hyperparameters.
    - Use automated hyperparameter optimization tools (e.g., GridSearchCV or Optuna).
  - **Data Augmentation**:
    - Expand the training dataset to include a broader variety of examples to improve generalization.

### **2. Class Imbalance Handling**

- **Issue**: The dataset is imbalanced, which may bias the model toward the majority class.

- **Suggestions**:
  - **Resampling Techniques**:
    - Oversample the minority class or undersample the majority class.
    - Use synthetic data generation methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).
  - **Class Weight Adjustment**:
    - Assign higher weights to the minority class during model training.
  - **Evaluation Metrics**:
    - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-score**, and **ROC-AUC** instead of relying solely on accuracy.

### **3. Small Training Dataset**
- **Issue**: The training dataset contains only 300 rows, which increases the risk of overfitting and reduces generalization.

- **Suggestions**:
  - **Data Augmentation**:
    - Use synthetic techniques to generate additional training samples.
    - Collect or acquire more data if possible.
  - **Cross-Validation**:
    - Implement K-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance on different subsets of the data.
  - **Regularization**:
    - Use regularization techniques (e.g., L1, L2 penalties) to combat overfitting.
